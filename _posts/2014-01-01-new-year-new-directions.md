Initial goals for 2014 include

- Setting up a new web server running node.js, using either AWS, Google Compute Engine or Windows Azure;
- Porting this project to work with node.js, which includes rewriting all the PHP code as server-side JavaScript;
- Deciding whether to separate PCjs from C1Pjs for the new web site, or simply make PCjs.org a mirror of jsmachines.net;
- Deciding how best (or even whether) to accomodate PCjs running from both **node** and **non-node** web servers.

I guess we'll learn more as the year progresses.
