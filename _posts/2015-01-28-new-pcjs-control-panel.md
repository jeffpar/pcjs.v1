A new PCjs Control Panel is under development, featuring a new "Display Panel" that will provide a variety of
information about the machine, in real-time, and operate more efficiently than previous DOM-based Control Panels.

A preview of the layout is shown below.  There's not much to see yet, as this is very much a work-in-progress.
