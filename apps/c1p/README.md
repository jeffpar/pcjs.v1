Challenger 1P Applications
---

All C1P applications come in two flavors:

- [BASIC](BASIC/)
- [6502 Machine-Language](6502/)

To make it easy for our machines to load our applications, we provide the following **Serial** configuration files:

- [all.xml](all.xml)
- [samples.xml](samples.xml)

These configuration files create UI controls that allow you to choose from a set of BASIC and/or 6502 machine-language
programs that are automatically sent to the C1P's serial port.
