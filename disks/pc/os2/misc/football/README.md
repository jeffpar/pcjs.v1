#### OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)

The [OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/football/87058/) contained a prototype version of OS/2
from February 1987 that was designed to test two important new features of the Intel 80386 processor: paging and V86-mode.
This prototype was forked from pre-1.0 OS/2 sources, and the only hardware it supported was the COMPAQ DeskPro 386-16.

#### OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v4.41.00)

The [OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v4.41.00)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/football/87357/) contained an updated FOOTBALL prototype.
It was built in December 1987, using final OS/2 1.0 sources merged with assorted FOOTBALL changes, and although 
it was originally assigned version number 1.3, this version of OS/2 would ultimately become 2.0.
