Microsoft Windows 95 (First Retail Release)
---

Windows 95 was the successor to Windows 3.1 and included a number of important new features:

 * Support for 32-bit Windows applications
 * Long mixed-case filenames (up to 255 characters)
 * GUI improvements (e.g., Explorer, **Start** button, Taskbar, shortcuts) 

It was also first version of Windows that *required* an 80386 CPU (preferably a D-stepping or later).

Windows 95 was released to manufacturing on July 14, 1995 and went on sale at midnight on August 24, 1995.

It is shown running below, following a "Compact Installation" on a 68Mb hard disk.  Before the machine can
start, it must download the disk image, which may take a minute or two, depending on the speed of your
internet connection.

More information about this Windows 95 demo is available in the [PCjs Blog](/blog/2015/09/21/).
