The Microsoft® Operating System/2 Programmer's Toolkit contains the latest tools, documentation, and sample programs
for developers writing MS® OS/2 programs.  The software for the toolkit is distributed on four disks labeled Tools,
Applications, Examples, and QuickHelp.

### Documentation

To help you find the information that you need, the following list briefly explains the contents of each manual in the
MS OS/2 Programmer's Toolkit:

+ *Microsoft Operating System/2 Programming Tools* describes the programming tools found in the MS OS/2 Programmer's
Toolkit.  You can use these tools to develop OS/2 programs.

+ *[Microsoft Operating System/2 Programmer's Learning Guide](/docs/os2/microsoft/ptk/1.0/plguide/)* teaches you the
fundamentals of programming for MS OS/2.  You will be led through the steps necessary to create your first MS OS/2
program and dynamic-link library.

+ *Microsoft Operating System/2 Programmer's Reference* gives the syntax and parameters of each MS OS/2 function,
and provides examples of how to use each function.

### Installing the MS OS/2 Programmer's Toolkit

To help you install the software for the toolkit, a **setup** program is provided on the Tools disk.  This program
prompts you for setup information, then loads the software onto your system. To run **setup**, type the following at
the A: prompt:

	setup

After running **setup**, make sure that you modify your PATH, INCLUDE, and LIB environment variables as directed by
the program.
