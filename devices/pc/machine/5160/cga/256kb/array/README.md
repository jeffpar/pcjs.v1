### Demonstration of Multiple IBM PCs on a Single Web Page

The simulations below are identical PC XT configurations, each with a clock speed of 4.77Mhz, 256Kb of RAM,
and a CGA display, using the original IBM PC Model 5160 ROM BIOS and CGA font ROM.  Each also includes an
empty/unformatted 10Mb hard disk. Use FDISK and then FORMAT to turn it into a usable C: drive.
